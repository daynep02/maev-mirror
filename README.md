## Name
The MAEV (Mass-Velocity) Engine

## Description
A game engine written in C++ that intends to think of everything in terms of sprites and vectors. This allows for robust collision detection and kinematics-based physics that is simple to implement.
These features will be represented with several examples:
	- A top-down racing game that can use vectors to simulate velocity, acceleration, car collision, etc.
	- A side-scrolling 2D platformer that can use vectors to invert gravity and forces
	- A top-down stealth-action game that can use vectors to calculate line-of-sight, bullet trajectory and reflections, etc.
	- A side-scrolling Metroidvania that can use vectors to implement attack rebounding
